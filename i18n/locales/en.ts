  philosophyIntro: 'Dancing is working on your happiness.',
  philosophyBody1:
    'No effort will bring you more benefits than learning and practicing a dance. The endorphins you produce while dancing generate an immediate increase in serotonin, and with it, your level of well-being. When you dance, you smile more, you like yourself more, you are more sociable, more flexible, and more understanding. If there is one thing capable of changing your life from the very first moment, it is, without a doubt, dancing.',
  philosophyBody2:
    'More than a conventional dance school, what Yunaisy Farray and her team offer is a center that reflects their artistic ideals and way of life. The activities at Farray’s International Dance Center are distinguished by following an exclusive and unique method created by Yunaisy Farray, which ensures fast, solid, and proven results.',

  // Dancehall FAQ
  dancehallFaqQ1: 'What exactly is dancehall?',
  dancehallFaqA1:
    "Dancehall is a style of music and dance that originated in Jamaica in the 70s. It's characterized by energetic movements, powerful rhythms ('riddims'), and a bold, confident attitude. It's much more than just steps: it's a complete cultural expression with its own history, music, and community. In our classes, you don't just learn the movements but also the culture and context behind them.",
  dancehallFaqQ2: 'Is dancehall difficult to learn?',
  dancehallFaqA2:
    'No more than any other dance style. Dancehall may seem intimidating at first due to its energy and rhythm, but our pedagogical approach breaks down each movement step by step. We start with the fundamentals (grooves, basic riddims) and advance gradually. Most of our beginner students are dancing full choreographies within a few weeks. The most important thing is attitude and the desire to have fun.',
  dancehallFaqQ3: 'Do I need to be in shape for dancehall classes?',
  dancehallFaqA3:
    "You don't need to be in specific shape to start. Dancehall itself is an excellent cardiovascular and endurance workout, so you'll improve your physical condition with each class. We work at different intensities and you can always adapt the movements to your current level. The important thing is to listen to your body and progress at your own pace.",
  dancehallFaqQ4: 'What should I wear to dancehall class?',
  dancehallFaqA4:
    "Comfortable, sporty clothing that allows you to move freely. Many students wear athletic pants or leggings and a t-shirt. For footwear, clean athletic shoes with good soles are ideal. Bring a water bottle because you're going to sweat! Optional: a small towel and your best attitude.",

  // Classes FAQ
  classesFaqQ1: "How many dance styles do you teach at Farray's Center?",
  classesFaqA1:
    'We offer training in over 25 different dance styles. Our catalog includes Latin dances (salsa, bachata, kizomba), urban dance (hip hop, dancehall, afrobeats, reggaeton), classical styles (ballet, contemporary, jazz), and specializations like physical preparation for dancers. This variety allows you to explore different styles and find those that resonate most with you, or specialize in one while complementing with others.',
  classesFaqQ2: 'Can I take classes in different styles at the same time?',
  classesFaqA2:
    'Of course! In fact, we recommend it. Learning multiple dance styles makes you a more complete and versatile dancer. For example, ballet improves your posture and technique for salsa, while hip hop can make your bachata more dynamic. Our class packages allow you to attend different types of classes according to your interests. Many of our most advanced students practice 3-4 styles simultaneously.',
  classesFaqQ3: 'How do I know which level is right for me?',
  classesFaqA3:
    "If it's your first class, we always recommend starting at the fundamentals or beginner level. However, if you have previous dance experience, our instructors can assess you in your first free class and recommend the most appropriate level. You can also try an intermediate level class if you feel the fundamentals are too basic. The important thing is that you feel challenged but not overwhelmed.",
  classesFaqQ4: 'How often should I attend classes to see progress?',
  classesFaqA4:
    'For consistent and noticeable progress, we recommend attending at least twice a week. At this frequency, most students see significant improvements in 2-3 months. If you can attend 3-4 times a week, progress will be even faster. However, even a weekly class will allow you to advance, albeit at a more gradual pace. Consistency is more important than intensity.',
  classesFaqQ5: 'Do you offer private or only group classes?',
  classesFaqA5:
    "We offer both options. Group classes are excellent for learning in community, making friends, and benefiting from the group's energy. Private classes are ideal if you seek personalized attention, have specific goals (like preparing for a presentation or wedding), or prefer a more flexible schedule. Many students combine both: regular group classes supplemented with occasional private sessions to work on specific aspects.",

  dhV3CulturalTitle: 'Dancehall History and Culture',
  dhV3CulturalShort: 'Dancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s as a natural evolution of reggae.',
  dhV3CulturalFull: '### The origins: Kingston, Jamaica (1970s–1980s)\n\nDancehall was born in the ghettos of Kingston in the late 70s. It emerged as a natural evolution of reggae when sound systems (mobile sound systems) began taking music to the streets and dancehalls. The name "dancehall" comes from those spaces where the community gathered to dance, socialize, and express themselves. It was where social tensions were released through music and movement.\n\n### The legends: Bogle, Passa Passa, and the pioneers\n\nGerald "Bogle" Levy (1964–2005) is considered the father of modern Dancehall. He created iconic moves like Bogle, Row Di Boat, Log On, and Willie Bounce, the foundation of the Dancehall vocabulary. Passa Passa, the legendary street dancehall sessions in Tivoli Gardens (Kingston), was the epicenter where new steps were born and dancers were consecrated. Other pioneers like Ding Dong, Keiva, John Hype, and crews like Ravers Clavers took Dancehall international in the 2000s.\n\n### Global expansion (2000s–present)\n\nIn the 2000s, Dancehall exploded globally thanks to artists like Sean Paul, Shaggy, Elephant Man, and Beenie Man. Social media and YouTube popularized steps like Dutty Wine, Daggering, and Nuh Linga. Today, Dancehall is a worldwide phenomenon with active communities in Europe, Africa, Asia, and America; Barcelona is one of its European epicenters.\n\n### The music: Riddims and Sound System culture\n\nDancehall is danced to riddims (instrumental bases) that producers create and multiple artists voice over. Legendary riddims like Diwali, Coolie Dance, or Dump Truck defined entire eras. Sound system culture—with its selectors, MCs, and the famous rewind when a song is so good it gets replayed from the start—is essential to understanding Dancehall.\n\n### More than dance: identity and resistance\n\nDancehall has always been a form of cultural resistance and identity expression for Jamaica\'s marginalized communities. It\'s the voice of the ghettos, a celebration of joy despite difficulties. Each step has meaning: Log On (connect), Willie Bounce (tribute to Willie Haggart), Nuh Linga (don\'t delay). Every movement tells a story.',
